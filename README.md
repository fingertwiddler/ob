# What

Offbase is a new approach to build web apps which gets avoids relying on a server.

Instead of synchronously synchronizing with a centralized server, Offbase adopts an asynchronous synchronization, allowing an app to do work locally, and then synchronize with a remote server when needed.

Offbase is essentially a framework that makes it easy to build these apps.
